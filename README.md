# Introduction

__Boxbrainiac__ is a straightforward application designed to manage the
contents of your carton boxes. With a simple web GUI and data storage in YAML,
it aims to make content management a breeze. It incorporates a git layer to
handle automatic pull, push, commit, and add commands when the YAML database
file is placed into a git repository. Please note that the git layer is
primarily designed for individual use and will not handle merge conflicts for
team use. The application has been tested and is compatible with Debian 9
Stretch and Debian 11 Bullseye.

# Installation

## Dependencies

__Boxbrainiac__ is dependent on Python version 3.5 or higher.

For Debian users, you can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
aptitude install python3-git python3-levenshtein python3-fuzzywuzzy \
python3-yaml python3-flask
```

# Usage & Examples

`boxbrainiac` is a command-line application with a variety of options to
customize its usage. Below are detailed examples provided of how to use each of
these options.

## Basic Usage

At its most basic, you can run `boxbrainiac` with no arguments:

```bash
boxbrainiac
```

This will start the application with default settings and print a URL. You can
point your browser to this URL and start using `boxbrainiac`.

## Print the Program Version

To check the version of the application, use the `--version` flag:

```bash
boxbrainiac --version
```

This command will return the current version of `boxbrainiac`.

## Customizing the Host and Port

By default, `boxbrainiac` will use the host and port specified in its
configuration. You can override this by using the `--host` and `--port`
options:

```bash
boxbrainiac --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

This command will start `boxbrainiac` on the IPv4 `localhost` address using
port 8080.

## Controlling Output Verbosity

`boxbrainiac` provides several options to control the verbosity of its output:

- To suppress all output in the terminal, use the `--quiet` option:

  ```bash
  boxbrainiac --quiet
  ```

- To print only the host and port to connect to, use the `--verbose` option:

  ```bash
  boxbrainiac --verbose
  ```

- For detailed output including many debug messages, use the `--debug` option:

  ```bash
  boxbrainiac --debug
  ```

## Specifying the Database Location

`boxbrainiac` allows you to specify the location of the database it should use.
This can be done using the `--repo_dir` or `--yaml_file` options:

- To use a specific directory for the database, use the `--repo_dir` option.
For example, the following command will use
`$HOME/my-boxbrainiac/data/boxbrainiac.yaml` as the database:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p $HOME/my-boxbrainiac/data
  boxbrainiac --repo_dir=$HOME/my-boxbrainiac/data
  ```

- To use a specific file for the database, use the `--yaml_file` option. For
example, the following command will use `$HOME/.boxbrainiac/data/cellar.yaml`
as the database:

  ```bash
  boxbrainiac --yaml_file=cellar.yaml
  ```

Remember to replace `127.0.0.1`, `8080`, `$HOME/my-boxbrainiac`, and
`cellar.yaml` with your actual host, port, directory path, and file name,
respectively.

With these options, you can customize `boxbrainiac` to suit your specific
needs. Happy organizing!

# Testing

## Test Dependencies for Python3

Three different approaches are provided for installing the test dependencies:

1. **Debian package manager**: Suitable if you want to use the application
   globally.
2. **Python3 globally**: Alternative to Debian package manager.
3. **Python3 locally inside a virtual environment**: Ideal for testing the
   application.

Here are the steps for each approach:

__Debian Way:__

```bash
aptitude install python3-html5lib python3-lxml python3-flask python3-mock
```

__Python Way:__

```bash
pip3 install html5lib lxml flask python-mock
```

__Virtual Environment:__

Follow the steps below to create a virtual environment, install test
dependencies, and run the test:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
cd /tmp # If not done
python3 -m venv venv # If not done
cd venv # If not done
source bin/activate # If not done
cd /tmp # If not done
git clone https://github.com/ckuelker/boxbrainiac # If not done

# Step 2: Install test dependencies locally inside the virtual environment
cd boxbrainiac
# For bash
pip install .[test]
# For zsh
pip install .\[test\]

# Step 3: Run the test
python3 -m unittest tests/test_*.py
```

# Build

## Dependencies

```bash
aptitude install python3-setuptools python3-wheel
```

## Building

To build the project, follow the steps below:

```bash
cd /tmp # if not done
python3 -m venv venv # If not done
cd venv # If not done
source bin/activate # If not done
cd /tmp/boxbrainiac
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

In case the global wheel is not accepted, install it inside the virtual
environment:

```bash
pip install wheel
```

# Install From Build

To install from the build, follow the steps below:

```bash
cd /tmp # if not done
python3 -m venv venv # If not done
cd venv # If not done
source bin/activate # If not done
cd /tmp/boxbrainiac
pip install dist/boxbrainiac-0.1.0.tar.gz # 1st method OR
pip install dist/boxbrainiac-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl # 2nd method
```

This will install it inside the virtual environment. It can also be installed
globally if required.

# Debugging Git

For a fast git debug `boxbrainiac` can be run from the repository like so

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/git-repository/boxbrainiac
export BIN=$PYTHONPATH/boxbrainiac/main.py
export DATA=/path/to/data-repository

python3 $BIN --repo_dir=$DATA -d
```
